It acts as a resilient and observable gateway orchestrating interactions with multiple AI providers, applying policies (gates, cadence, canary), and facilitating deterministic diff application. The overall system aims to transform `.lkt.txt` specifications into automated Pull Requests, measuring impact and self-adjusting based on policies, all while emphasizing vendor neutrality and production readiness.",

The broader ecosystem integration with GoBE, gdbase, and logz, while conceptually defined, also requires further detailed implementation and API contracts.
