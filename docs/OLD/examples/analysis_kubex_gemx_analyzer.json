    {
      "title": "Unify LookAtni Integration for Client-Side Extraction",
      "description": "The `frontend/components/input/LookAtniDirectExtractor.tsx` component attempts client-side code extraction, but its implementation in `LookAtniDirectExtractor.tsx` contains placeholder logic for `lookatni-core` not being available in the browser. Meanwhile, a server-side `lookatni` handler exists. This dual approach creates confusion and potential for incomplete functionality or duplication of effort. The current implementation for `LookAtniDirectExtractor` seems to be a mock or incomplete browser-native extraction.",
      "priority": "High",
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "businessImpact": "Streamlining this integration will provide a more coherent and robust code extraction experience, reducing reliance on the backend for basic file processing and improving user perception of client-side capabilities."
    },
    {
      "title": "Complete DORA/AI Metrics Integrations (Jira, WakaTime)",
      "description": "The `daemon.go` and `internal/integration/gobe.go` files indicate planned integrations with Jira for workflows and WakaTime for analytics, which are crucial for a complete DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) and AI Impact Metrics (HIR/AAC/TPH) calculation. The current `test_metrics_validation.go` uses mock clients, signaling that these external API integrations are not yet live or fully implemented.",
      "priority": "High",
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "businessImpact": "Fully implementing these integrations will enable the platform to collect real-world data, providing accurate and actionable DORA and AI impact metrics, which is a core value proposition of the analyzer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Enhance Advise Command with Full AI Capabilities",
      "description": "The `cmd/cli/gateway.go` `adviseCommand` explicitly states it's 'not fully implemented yet' and the `/v1/advise` endpoint in `internal/gateway/transport/http.go` returns mock responses. While `internal/advise/handler.go` has a structure for `AdviseReq` and `systemPrompt`, the actual AI-driven logic to generate detailed, real-time advice based on scorecard data is missing or incomplete.",
      "priority": "Medium",
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "businessImpact": "A fully functional and AI-driven 'advise' command is critical for delivering immediate value to users by turning raw metrics into actionable recommendations, enhancing the platform's intelligence and utility."
    },
    {
      "title": "Implement Robust Data Persistence for Application State",
      "description": "The `config/.env.example` lists `DATABASE_URL` as 'future use' and `docker-compose.yml` includes Redis as 'Optional: Redis for caching (future use)'. While the frontend uses IndexedDB for persistent state, a centralized, robust database solution is not yet integrated for core application data beyond in-browser storage. This could limit advanced features requiring server-side state or complex queries.",
      "priority": "Medium",
      "difficulty": "High",
      "businessImpact": "Establishing a robust database backend will enable more complex features like multi-user support, long-term trend analysis, advanced reporting, and more resilient data management, crucial for a production-grade platform."
    },
    {
      "title": "Complete Frontend Internationalization for Dynamic Content",
      "description": "While the frontend has `en-US` and `pt-BR` locales, certain dynamic content elements, such as `dynamicPhrases` and `featureDetails` in `landing.ts`, still use hardcoded English keys (`titleKey`, `descriptionKey`, `detailKey`) instead of fully translated strings. This indicates incomplete internationalization for some user-facing elements.",
      "priority": "Low",
      "difficulty": "Low",
      "businessImpact": "Completing the internationalization of all dynamic content will improve the user experience for non-English speakers, making the application feel more polished and globally accessible."
